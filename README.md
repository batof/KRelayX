## Features ðŸ”¥
- Connect to KRelayX with Exalt or a flash client and use custom written plugins to change game behaviour
- Injects a Proxy Server into the Exalt server list for easier connection, no Fiddler required
- Warns you in-game if KRelayX is running but you aren't connected to the Proxy Server
- Default plugins such as AutoNexus, AutoAbility, SpamStopper, TutorialMode and more.. see [Default Plugins](#default-plugins) for a full list
- *(coming soon)* - `Exalt custom DLL injection to allow for internal game hooking without a proxy` 
- *(coming soon)* - `Automatic updating by checking our game version against an API with the most recent version hash and downloading new XML files`

## Plugins ðŸ”Œ  
`Lib-KRelayX` provides helper functions for hooking incoming/outgoing game packets, sending game packets and spoofing incoming server packets to the connected client.  
The [Plugins](https://github.com/abrn/KRelayX/tree/main/Plugins/) folder provides examples on plugins that have been written by numerous people and should serve as the best guide for creating your own.
